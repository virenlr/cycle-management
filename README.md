# Cycle Management

## About
Cycle Management is the official Android app of the Kengeri Campus, CHRIST (Deemed to be University) and is used for the efficient management of cycles at the Kengeri Campus, aiming to increase the accountability on the part of the student community, while also making it easier for the management to track and maintain cycles within the premises.

## Survey
Having identified a problem with the current system of cycle management at a Deanery Level Student Council meeting, we unveiled our solution: the Cycle Management Android application. The app is installed on the Android mobile phones of the security guards on the campus, who are all provided with high-speed Wi-Fi access. To ensure the security of the system, one designated member of the management will have access to the admin-panel interface, allowing them to create and remove accounts of the security guards. Account creation is a one-time process, and if the guard forgets their password, they can reset their password from within the app itself.

Cycles are placed at two strategic locations on campus- Devadan Block and Fourth Block. All cycles have key-locks, and the keys to these locks are in the possession of the guard on duty at that venue. When a student wants to borrow a cycle, they approach the guard, who will only give the key to a particular cycle to the student after registering the student's name and basic information on the app. The app is cloud-connected, meaning that the application data will reflect on the devices of all guards who have it installed.

## Features

### Home screen
In the home screen, you will notice that there are four different color indicators against the cycles. Green indicates that a cycle is available, and the location of the cycle on campus is mentioned beneath the cycle. Orange indicates that a cycle has been given to a student and is in-use. Red indicates that one or more parts of the cycle have been broken. Should a cycle be completely removed/discarded, it can be decommissioned, and will then have a Black indicator against its name.

### Editor
When a cycle is clicked on in the list, it will open up a details screen that will allow the guard to assign it to a student, de-assign it from a student, mark any of the cycle parts as damaged, or decommission it entirely. Instructions on the page make it easier for the guard to understand its functioning, and can be translated into different languages at a later time depending on the feasibility/requirement.

### Statistics
Statistics allows guards to have an overview of all the cycles on campus- the ones that are available, in-use, broken, or decommissioned. They are also able to see the number of available cycles at either of the two venues. They will receive information on the cumulative damage to all the cycles, thus allowing them to plan repairs accordingly.

### History
The History option allows for the guard to see the entire history of cycle allotment and return. Information such as the borrowed time, return time, the guard who received the cycle, the registration number of the student, full name of the student, phone number of the student, and the locations from which the cycle was borrowed from and returned to are all recorded within the app.

## Conclusion
The Cycle Management application was officially launched on 22nd March 2019 at the Gratitude Day celebration of the Faculty of Engineering, CHRIST (Deemed to be University). It was rolled out in the following months, in an attempt to solve the issues being experienced.
